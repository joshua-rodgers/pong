this is like my capstone for n00bness 101 or something. i see pong as the most fundamental expression of a 2d game. this is my first time really attempting to implement it 
completely from my head, no tutorials, no videos, just feeling it out, using my code instincts. if i can build a complete implementation, suffice it to say, it will be a 
big deal to me personally. 

so far ive just built the window and defined the game objects: the paddles and the ball. ive added an input class to handle key presses. next will be to begin to work out 
the movement of the ball and its interactions with the edges.
