this is like my capstone for n00bness 101 or something. i see pong as the most fundamental expression of a 2d game. this is my first time really attempting to implement it 
completely from my head, no tutorials, no videos, just feeling it out, using my code instincts. if i can build a complete implementation, suffice it to say, it will be a 
big deal to me personally.
